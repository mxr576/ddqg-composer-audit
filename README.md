Drupal Dependency Quality Gate Composer Audit plugin
---

This project extends `compsoer audit` command with new "advisories" originating from the results generated by the
[mxr576/ddqg](https://packagist.org/packages/mxr576/ddqg) project that aims to help run Drupal projects on secure and high-quality
Drupal dependencies.

<img alt="Family Guy, Consuela says: No, no, no low-quality dependencies" height="250" src="https://i.imgflip.com/7ijrpx.jpg"/>

**CHECKOUT** the [mxr576/composer-audit-changes](https://packagist.org/packages/mxr576/composer-audit-changes)
"alternative" `composer audit` command because it can help with the adoption of this package on existing projects
with collected technical debt.

## Installation

```shell
$ composer require --dev mxr576/ddqg-composer-audit
```

### Composer version support

The minimum required version is Composer 2.4.0 because the `composer audit` command was introduced in that version.
The recommended version is Composer 2.6.0 because it introduced essential improvements for the audit feature like
[the support for multiple repositories to provide advisories for the same package](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/11435)
or [the advisory ignore feature](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#ignore).

## Example output

```
$ composer audit

## Configuration

Quality Assurance can feel painful, but it is an important part of professional software development. The goal of this
project is to bring attention about dependency quality problems on a project. For all these reasons, it deliberately
comes with minimal opt-out options.

### Silence warning about an unsupported package version

> [!WARNING]
> For Composer < 2.6.0 only. This feature will be removed when the minimum required Composer version gets bumped to >=2.6.0.

In a project's root composer.json, under the `extra` property, add a definition like this:

```json
        "ddqg-composer-audit": {
            "ignore-unsupported-versions": {
                "vendor/package": "an_explicit_version_string",
                "drupal/tamper": "1.0.0-alpha3"
            }
        }
```

The other option is defining a comma separate list of ignore rules in the
`DDQG_COMPOSER_AUDIT_IGNORE_UNSUPPORTED_VERSIONS` environment
variable, e.g,
`DDQG_COMPOSER_AUDIT_IGNORE_UNSUPPORTED_VERSIONS=drupal/tamper:1.0.0-alpha3,vendor/package:1.x-dev`

The environment variable has a higher precedence; if it is defined, the definition in a project's root composer.json is
ignored completely.

Notice: A warning is still displayed about the ignored unsupported package on STDERR.

**Not supporting version ranges in the definition was a conscious decision because (again) the goal is making
dependency quality problems constantly visible and not sweeping them under the carpet.**

### Check Drupal 10 compatibility

For projects running on Drupal 9 still. When this feature is enabled then `composer audit` can also check whether an
installed package dependency version is also compatible with Drupal 10 or not. This can make the Drupal 10 upgrade more
painless.

**The feature is disabled by default**, it can be enabled with:

```json
        "ddqg-composer-audit": {
            "check-d10-compatibility": true
        }
```

or by setting the `DDQG_COMPOSER_AUDIT_CHECK_D10_COMPATIBILITY=true` environment variable.

**This is a seasonal feature that will be removed after Drupal 9 EOL.**

## Integrations

* "Unofficial" [build definition](https://gist.github.com/mxr576/5f87063eb2e1e2b125257878018f048d) for a Docker
  image that installs the latest version from this Composer plugin and the [composer audit-changes](https://packagist.org/packages/mxr576/composer-audit-changes)
  command

## FAQ

### Drupal Packagist already provides package advisories, so why should I care about this plugin?

This feature is only available on Drupal Packagist since 21 September 2023. Security advisory data via
Drupal Packagist only contains information based on published security advisories; it does not contain
releases flagged as ["insecure"](https://www.drupal.org/taxonomy/term/188131), but this Composer plugin does.
